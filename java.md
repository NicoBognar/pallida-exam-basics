# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up


# Tasks
## 1-3. Complete the following tasks: (~90 mins)

## 4. Question time! (~10 mins) [4p]
 
###  What is the difference between a function and a method? [2p]
#### Your answer:
Methods and functions exist in every object oriented language.
A function is a piece of code, that is self standing and can return some value, for example adding 
two integers together. For this calculation, you don't need object, you can just pass the two variables and get the result.

A method is a piece of code that has its name associated with an object, so it's not standalone, as function.
Methods are performing operations with the objects that are already existing.
Methods basically do the same thing as functions, but it is really important that they are always associated with 
objects.


### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
Constructor is used to create and initialize an object, that is not existing yet.
Constructor looks similar to method, it has access modifier, name, parameter, but it doesn't return anything!
Also it's name HAS TO BE identical to the class name.
